<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave from On Photography by Susan Sontag 500-word reflection</i></h3>
<p>In these days of never ending upgrades of electronics and technology when everybody can pick up a phone and be able to capture every moment of daily life, I sometimes wonder, do we take photos because we are excited to preserve our memories, or simply because we feel compelled to photograph everything? Susan Sontag’s article in Plato’s Cave brought my attention about this question. While reading this gave me lots of interesting ideas about the understanding between photographs and human perception.</p>
<p>By drawing on Plato’s allegory of the cave, Sontag described the perspective of photograph and shadow as a sort of reality which can shape us how we see the world.
I think this metaphor powerfully shows how photograph are actually mediated photo that frame and filter reality. She claims that photographs hold a special authority because they look like reality itself, unlike panting and drawing which created by hand of the artist. However, photographs are not neutral. Every photograph reflects their point of view differently, the result of 
choices by framing, timing, lighting or even a second before the shutter is pressed influence what we see as well. These idea is perfectly proving that no photograph is ever neutral.</p>
<p>Moreover, The Sontag’s point about photography as a selective form strongly increases today. As an innovation of currently technology, smart phone application has been developed with lots of features and made us be able to change or edit easier like we are be able to draw our images with our imagination. AI-generated photos are the unpredictable trends that no one expected. It is a biggest innovation that changes our life and society. Everybody can edit photographs or generate images by their own hands anytime wherever they want by just using application like ChatGPT or Adobe Photoshop. Another interesting point is not even teenagers or adults who had the ability to editing, but young generation like Generation Alpha who owned smartphone also sometime are the producer of those photos and contents in social media as well. The fact that people of all ages can so easily manipulate images and photos make me question how much we can truly trust the current media we see on social platforms. It is become very hard for us as a consumer to understand and analyze whether this photo is real or a piece of art that edited on purpose to engaging the view for a social media content.The effect of photograph also visible in the present moment. Photographs of tragedy or injustice can be easily captured and often spark global movement, as seen in protest or tragedy natural environment disaster. A powerful example is the photograph  of George Floyd, which ignited worldwide demonstrations against racial injustice.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sontag’s idea remains relevant today that photographs are never neutral. The fragments of reality can enlighten us and also mislead us. Thus, in the world of filters, edits and Ai-generated images, the relationship between photographs and human consumption are the real factor that human should concern as a priority to determined photo. We must learn not only to take photograph but also criticizing, questioning what they show or hiding. </p>
