<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave from On Photography by Susan Sontag 500-word reflection</i></h3>
<p>In these days of never ending upgrades of electronics and technology when everybody can pick up a phone and be able to capture every moment of daily life, I sometimes wonder, do we take photos because we are excited to preserve our memories, or simply because we feel compelled to photograph everything? Susan Sontag’s article in Plato’s Cave brought my attention about this question. While reading this gave me lots of interesting ideas about the understanding between photographs and human perception.</p>
<p>By drawing on Plato’s allegory of the cave, Sontag described the perspective of photograph and shadow as a sort of reality which can shape us how we see the world.
I think this metaphor powerfully shows how photograph are actually mediated photo that frame and filter reality. She claims that photographs hold a special authority because they look like reality itself, unlike panting and drawing which created by hand of the artist. However, photographs are not neutral. Every photograph reflects their point of view differently, the result of 
choices by framing, timing, lighting or even a second before the shutter is pressed influence what we see as well. These idea is perfectly proving that no photograph is ever neutral.</p>
<p>Moreover, The Sontag’s point about photography as a selective form strongly increases today. As an innovation of currently technology, smart phone application has been developed with lots of features and made us be able to change or edit easier like we are be able to draw our images with our imagination. AI-generated photos are the unpredictable trends that no one expected. It is a biggest innovation that changes our life and society. Everybody can edit photographs or generate images by their own hands anytime wherever they want by just using application like ChatGPT or Adobe Photoshop. Another interesting point is not even teenagers or adults who had the ability to editing, but young generation like Generation Alpha who owned smartphone also sometime are the producer of those photos and contents in social media as well. The fact that people of all ages can so easily manipulate images and photos make me question how much we can truly trust the current media we see on social platforms. It is become very hard for us as a consumer to understand and analyze whether this photo is real or a piece of art that edited on purpose to engaging the view for a social media content.The effect of photograph also visible in the present moment. Photographs of tragedy or injustice can be easily captured and often spark global movement, as seen in protest or tragedy natural environment disaster. A powerful example is the photograph  of George Floyd, which ignited worldwide demonstrations against racial injustice.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sontag’s idea remains relevant today that photographs are never neutral. The fragments of reality can enlighten us and also mislead us. Thus, in the world of filters, edits and Ai-generated images, the relationship between photographs and human consumption are the real factor that human should concern as a priority to determined photo. We must learn not only to take photograph but also criticizing, questioning what they show or hiding. </p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>After reading The Guardian article about “AI slop,” I began to think deeply about how artificial intelligence is quietly changing the way we see and feel about the world. The writer describes two parallel image channels that dominate our everyday life, one full of real pictures from news, politics, and human events, and another filled with endless AI-generated content that imitates reality but lacks meaning or human emotion. This idea really struck me because I realized how much of my daily visual experience—on Instagram, TikTok, or even WhatsApp is already shaped by these artificial images, even when I don’t notice it.</p>
<p>The article calls this flood of low quality, machine made images “AI slop.” At first, I thought of it as harmless—cute fantasy art or funny memes—but the more I read, the more I understood how dangerous it can be. It’s not only about fake pictures but also about how these images distort our sense of what is real. For example, some AI videos imagine political victories for Trump or create false emotional scenes, such as a crying woman arrested by immigration officers in Studio Ghibli style. When those kinds of images appear online, they look believable and emotionally powerful, even if they are completely made up. That realization made me feel uneasy because it means that anyone, anywhere, can now create propaganda without needing real evidence.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting was the idea that AI is not neutral. The scholar quoted in the article, Prof. Roland Meyer, says generative AI is “structurally conservative” because it learns from old data that often reinforces stereotypes about race, gender, and sexuality. This point made me reflect on how AI images often show “ideal” white, traditional families or submissive women. They are not random results of technology, but reflections of the cultural bias inside the data. I realized that this technology can easily be used to romanticize inequality or to make fascist ideas look beautiful. As someone who studies media and culture, I think this shows why critical thinking and media literacy are more important than ever. Another part that stayed with me was about misinformation spreading through chat apps like WhatsApp. The author mentioned an older relative who believes fake videos about the war in Sudan. It reminded me of my own family and how they sometimes share emotional or dramatic news without checking if it’s true. These moments show how difficult it has become to separate truth from manipulation when even fake images feel real and come from people we trust.</p>
<p>By the end of the article, I felt a sense of warning and responsibility. The author describes how our minds are being desensitized by this endless stream of unreal images how real suffering becomes just another post to scroll past. That reflection hit me hard because I realized I also consume serious news mixed with entertainment and cute AI pictures. Everything feels both too real and unreal at the same time. It made me want to slow down and question what I see, to remember that truth and empathy require effort.
In the end, this article didn’t just make me aware of AI slop but it made me aware of myself. In a world flooded with fake visuals, learning to see clearly and think critically might be one of the most human acts left.</p>
