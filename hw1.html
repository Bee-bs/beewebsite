<h1>Homework 1: Web Development</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Bee - a Bangkok-born, New York-based illustrator and graphic Designer.</p>
<p>My journey began during the pandemic, when I picked up a pencil again after seven years. 
	This turning point brought me back to myself and helped me rediscover my passion and who I truly am.
	I am especially like portraits - focusing on mostly the human face and hands - as a way of capturing depth, emotion and presence.
	I also love collecting art books from animation and game studios to inspire and continue my imagination.</p>
<p>My Art is inspired by blending reality with contemporary art and nostalgia to create dreamlike visual story telling. 
    Each piece reflects the joy and playfulness of life, as well as the shadows of sadness and tension, all shaped directly by my experience.
    Beyond illustration, I also enjoy exloring design and visual art at the museum.
    Sometime I wander around the city and capturing moments as a way to relax and enjoying of everyday life.</p>
