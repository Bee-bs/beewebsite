<h1>Homework 4</h1>
<h3>Photo 1</h3>
<img src="hw-5-medp150.jpg" width="500px">
<p>The first photo represents the city I love - Tokyo, Japan. This Vibrant city is surrounded by towering building. It's been popular among people around the world because its unique blend of tradition and modern culture
However, I often imagine what it would feel like if the city were softened with more greenery and more cutural architecture. So I added up the grass on the ground and add another construction
  "Tour eiffle" from Paris, France another city that I love to connected and express the vision of my personality connection and intrests.

<h3>Photo 2</h3>

<p> The Second photo represent the heritage art of Thailand "Ramakien" the natio's epic, that continues to inspire art and imagination today. The story of Hanuman (The monkey god)
  remain one of the most fascinating through this photomontage, I want to highlight how ancient traditions still shape today's Thai society. The Royal ploughing ceremony is an example 
 and still symbolized prosperity, predicts the harvest and uplift the spirit of farmers acroos the nation. This ceremony still held every year, reflects how deeply Thailand's culural
roots continue to nourish its present. I hope to share this unique cultural legacy through my work.</p>
